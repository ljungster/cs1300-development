          This was my final project for my university's UI/UX course. I built an
          app using the React framework, focuing on JavaScript filtering and
          sorting methods. I've loved Pokemon since I was a kid, so I decided to
          make an app that allows you to build your own team! I interfaced with
          the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">PokeApi</a> in order
          to get my Pokemon data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="usability col-8">
        <h1 class="text-center">Usability</h1>
        <p>
          Above all, I made sure that this app was user friendly. It is easy to
          change filtering/sorting setups and add/remove pokemon to your team.
          No refresh needed! I also made sure that each button was a different
          color. That way, it was clear that they did different things. In the
          future, I would like to change the active links to be more visible.
          Currently, they are a very light gray, which does not contrast well
          with the other navigation items.
